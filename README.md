# Computer-Graphics

OpenGL Project for the 2023-1 Computer Graphics course at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María.

The idea was to project the 3 faces of a cube (digitally) into a real cube using a projector. The faces must move (Left Click and move on every vertex) and change their content (using Right Click on every face). The images selected created an interesting effect, cause the projected cube had more cubes projected in it, and changed colours with every right click.
